Hi,

This project is a web site that i did for my son. He is a young fisher and he wanted something to list the fishes he fished.
So i do this app for him.

To install this project, you can clone the repository wiht the git clone command then do composer install the get all the required dependencies.
You need XAMPP, WAMPP, LAMPP or use the symfony serve (by doing symfony serve in a terminal) to transform your machine as a server.
