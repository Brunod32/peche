Hi,

I made this project to practice symfony.
It is a web site that i did for my son. He is a young fisher and he wanted something to list the fishes he fished.
So i do this app for him.

To install this project:

`git clone `

To install the required dependencies:

`composer install` 


You need XAMPP, WAMPP, LAMPP or use the symfony serve to transform your machine as a server

`symfony serve`

The register page does not appear in this interface. If you clone the repository and test the app, you have to type the route 
/register in the address bar to create an account.

Thank you.
